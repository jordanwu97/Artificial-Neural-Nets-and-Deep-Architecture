3 Images is the max the network can store. Images are given 0.2 noise.
When given 4 images, network doesn't converge to correct image

For random patterns: 50 images.

Difference between the random vs given images is orthogonality. The given images are much less orthogonal versus the random images.


stable samples?


without self connection wii the network can store more random patterns (about 65)

biasing dramatically reduces this value to 5
