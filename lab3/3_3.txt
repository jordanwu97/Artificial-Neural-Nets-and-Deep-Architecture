1) Network might not converge in the sense that states will be stable. Might jump to a different state with the same energy.
2) 
Energy at Attractors
p1 & -490288.0
p2 & -465114.66667
p3 & -498090.66667

Energy at Distorted
p10 & -140964.0
p11 & -58197.33333

3) When weight matrix is not symetric, energy is not monotonic decreasing w.r.t. iterations

4) Energy is monotonic decreasing
