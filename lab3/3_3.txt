1) Network might not converge in the sense that states will be stable. Might jump to a different state with the same energy.

2) 
Energy at Attractors
p1 & -491312.0
p2 & -466138.66667
p3 & -499114.66667
Energy at Distorted
p10 & -141988.0
p11 & -59221.33333

3) When weight matrix is not symetric, energy is not monotonic decreasing w.r.t. iterations. Results in random ups and downs.

4) Energy is decreasing generally, but not monotonic. If we set the diagonal of the weight matrix to 0, then it becomes monotonic decreasing.
